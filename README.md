A technical test based on [this repo](https://github.com/JuniorBoaventura/iOS-ForecastTest) from [KDVL](https://github.com/KDVL).

## TASKS DONE
- ForecastService implemented using Global dependency injection
- Added day and description to display on ListViewController cells
- Added swipe to delete to ListViewController cells feature
- Added navigation to DetailView using List and Detail coordinators
- Added basic DetailView design
- Added a demo mod on ForecastServiceProvider so it bypasses the network calls and uses static data instead
